# Config files
## Notes to self
This nvim config works on ubuntu OS: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS x86_64
For transparent background, make sure you have a compositor like picom. (It works with i3wm)
I use feh to set background in my i3 config, so it applied by default when the system starts

Do not use the gnome terminal, I use kitty to support transparent terms, and the config and text look much more clearer in kitty.

Use Ohmybash to get git intergration with bash terminal, I use the 'font' preset in ohmybash

Set vim mode in bash for blazingly fast terminal text manipulation

For tmux, copy my conf, as it sets some good defaults. PLEASE INSTALL TPM, It help installing tmux packages like tmux-yank which is extremly useful in yanking terminal text to system buffer

Make sure kitty is the default terminal throughout the system. I have some commands in linux-commands repo for this

Set the default system font to nerdfont ttf file which is given in this rep

For nevoim, make sure to install nvm, pyenv for properly managing node and python versions.

Just clone this rep at home folder.
you might need to tinker with tmux to make it read from the correct config file in XDG_CONFIG_HOME, or you can just copy paste this config in the config file generated by default

And all set!
